# Analytics Repository 


This repository is the meat and potatoes -- here's where you'll find the source code supporting research and analytics projects that I'm actively looking into.

This sub-directory contains a DBT project that writes data to SQL transformations. 
Currently in process of configuring and staging data, this will be where the bulk of data modeling happens.
